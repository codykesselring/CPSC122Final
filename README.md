CPSC 122 Final 
Technical Report
introduction:
I chose my spotify data because I thought it would be interesting to visualize my spotify habits. The source data is within 4 json files with data from 02/2022 to 02/2023. I include tables of uncleaned and cleaned data including heatmaps, barcharts, and line graphs.Collected by parsing through source files and searching for specific attributes 
including time of day and total ms played of a specific artist
Impacts include:
Greater self awareness: better understand of listening habits and music preferences
Ethics: why did my Kanye playtime increase so significantly after his anti-semitic remarks?
Stakeholders might be interested with this data on a larger scale to know what songs may be marketable for specific audiences
